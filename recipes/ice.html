                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>Sometimes you just need to make some ice.<br>
                    Here's some instructions on how to do that.</p>

                <h1>Ingredients</h1>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Water</li>
                    
                </ul>

                <h1>Steps</h1>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Clean the ice tray:</strong>Ensure your ice cube tray is clean. Any residue in the tray could potentially end up in your ice cubes, affecting their taste and clarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fill the ice tray:</strong>Fill each compartment of the ice cube tray with cold water. Don't overfill because water expands as it freezes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Freeze the water:</strong>Carefully place the ice tray into your freezer. Try to keep it on a flat surface so the water doesn't spill out.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wait:</strong>Leave the water to freeze. This will usually take about 2-4 hours, depending on your freezer settings and the size of the ice cubes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Remove the ice cubes:</strong>Once the water is fully frozen, you can remove the ice tray from the freezer. Twist the tray or push the bottom of each compartment to dislodge the ice cubes.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Congratulations, you've made ice! Remember that for best taste, it's a good idea to use filtered water, especially if your tap water has a strong taste or odor. And, if you need clear ice cubes for cocktail purposes, you might need to use a method called directional freezing, which is a little more complex.</p>
