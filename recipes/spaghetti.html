            <h1>Ingredients</h1>
            
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
                <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 can, 28 ounces of crushed tomatos</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of dried basil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>pinch of sugar</li>
                <li>1 pound of spaghetti</li>
                <li>salt for pasta and water</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Steps</h1>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Start the sauce</strong>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                <li><strong>Add the tomatoes and spices</strong>Pour in the crushed tomatoes, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. If your tomatoes are a bit acidic, a pinch of sugar can help balance the flavors. Stir everything together and let the sauce come to a simmer.</li>
                <li><strong>Let the sauce cook</strong>Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the spaghetti</strong>While the sauce is simmering, fill a large pot with water, add a generous amount of salt, and bring it to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
                <li><strong>Drain the spaghetti</strong>Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it in a colander. Do not rinse the spaghetti as the starch helps the sauce adhere better.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine the spaghetti and sauce</strong>Add the drained spaghetti to the saucepan with the sauce. Toss until the spaghetti is fully coated in the sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a side of garlic bread, if desired. Enjoy your homemade spaghetti with marinara sauce!</li>
